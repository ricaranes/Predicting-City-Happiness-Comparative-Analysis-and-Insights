#Predicting City Happiness: Comparative Analysis and Insights


#Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my predictive modeling project aimed at estimating the happiness index of cities. In this project, I have developed a Python model to predict the happiness index based on various factors. The analysis includes a comparison between Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, and other cities used for model training. Additionally, a comparison between Lisbon, Porto, and Bragança was conducted to understand the factors impacting population happiness.

#Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model for estimating the happiness index of cities. By leveraging a dataset obtained from Kaggle and additional data collected from Google, I have trained a model using Python. The trained model was then utilized to predict the happiness index of two Portuguese cities and compare them with Lisbon, the capital city. The aim was to identify the factors that significantly influence happiness and determine their impact on the population's well-being.

#Data Sources
The following data sources were utilized for this project:

Kaggle: [Dataset containing various city features](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/healthy-lifestyle-cities-report-2021)
Google: Additional data collected to enrich the dataset

#Methodology

The project involved the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathering the dataset from Kaggle and collecting additional relevant data from Google to enhance the feature set.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the collected data to ensure consistency and compatibility for analysis.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant features that contribute to the happiness index based on their impact and relevance.
Model Training: Utilizing Python to train a predictive model using the selected features.
Prediction and Comparison: Applying the trained model to predict the happiness index of two Portuguese cities and comparing them with Lisbon.
Analysis and Insights: Analyzing the results to understand the factors influencing happiness in different cities and deriving meaningful insights.


#Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

data: Contains the dataset files used for analysis.
notebooks: Includes Jupyter notebooks with the code and documentation for the analysis steps.
visualizations: Contains visual representations of the data, such as charts and graphs, created using Tableau.
README.md: The current file, providing an overview of the project.


#Results and Findings
Through this analysis, several insights were derived regarding the factors impacting happiness in cities. Some of the key findings include:

Identification of the significant factors influencing the happiness index.
Comparison of Lisbon's happiness index with other cities used for model training.
Comparative analysis between Lisbon, Porto, and Bragança to understand the variations in happiness levels.
Visual representations of the data using charts, graphs, and maps to present the findings effectively.

#Future Steps
While this project has provided valuable insights, there are potential avenues for further exploration. Some future steps to enhance the analysis include:

Incorporating additional relevant variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding of happiness determinants.
Conducting statistical tests to assess the significance of the identified factors.
Validating the model's performance using additional datasets and advanced techniques.

#Conclusion
In conclusion, this project utilized predictive modeling techniques to estimate the happiness index of cities. Through comparative analysis, valuable insights were gained into the factors impacting happiness levels. These findings can contribute to the understanding of population well-being and inform policies and initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life in cities.
